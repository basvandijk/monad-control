Category:            Control
Build-type:          Simple
Cabal-version:       >= 1.6
Description:
  This package defines the type class @MonadBaseControl@, a subset of
  @MonadBase@ into which generic control operations such as @catch@ can be
  lifted from @IO@ or any other base monad. Instances are based on monad
  transformers in @MonadTransControl@, which includes all standard monad
  transformers in the @transformers@ library except @ContT@.
  .
  See the @lifted-base@ package which uses @monad-control@ to lift @IO@
  operations from the @base@ library (like @catch@ or @bracket@) into any monad
  that is an instance of @MonadBase@ or @MonadBaseControl@.
  .
  Note that this package is a rewrite of Anders Kaseorg's @monad-peel@
  library. The main difference is that this package provides CPS style operators
  and exploits the @RankNTypes@ and @TypeFamilies@ language extensions to
  simplify and speedup most definitions.
  .
  The following @criterion@ based benchmark shows that @monad-control@ is on
  average about 99% faster than @monad-peel@:

Flag instanceST
  Description:
    If enabled this package will export MonadBaseControl instances for the lazy
    and strict ST monad. If disabled these instances are only exported when base
    >= 4.4. If enabled it is required that the transformer-base package exports
    MonadBase instances for ST. It will do this by default.
  Default: True
